# Impartial Games
Play impartial games such as Nim and White Knights against an AI that plays perfectly.

## How To Setup
Use the aside on the right to add nim heaps or pieces to the games.
Make a move at anytime and the AI will make a response within a few seconds.
After the game has finished, use the clear button in the aside to setup a new game.
